# Which City Is Closer?

Android native Java App


“Which city is closer” is a fun and challenging geography quiz game that tests your knowledge of distances around the world. 
Everyone knows that Paris is the capital of France, but where exactly is it located? Is it closer to Madrid or Berlin? This game will help you to find out! 
Each round you will be given a random city and asked which of the other two cities is closer in a straight line distance. Please note it is not the road distance. You will get a point for every correctly answered question. Every time you give the wrong answer, you will have to start all over again.
